      This is, like, so cool! And, I mean, it's just so easy to make them!
      Animations make websites look so fresh and innovative! They're great for
      the UI because it makes the website very user-friendly, as well. I think
      I'm gonna stick with them. Gotta keep learning! Gotta keep getting better!
